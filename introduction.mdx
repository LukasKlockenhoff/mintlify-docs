## The Idea

Piguesse is a Project for the 4th Semester of Computer Science Study a HWR Berlin. The Idea is to create a Web Based Game that uses TensorflowJS to use a machine learning model in the browser. The purpose of the game is to explore the possibilities of machine learning in the browser and to create a fun game that uses this technology. The game was heavily inspired by "Quick, Draw!" from Google and used its dataset to train the model.

## About the Docs

This documentation gives some insight into how Piguesso is being created and how the game works. It also gives some insight into the machine learning model and how it was trained. The documentation is created with Mintlify, a documentation tool that allows you to create beautiful and interactive documentation with ease. We will dicuss a couple of things along the way.
